<h1>About Us</h1>

<p><strong>Buying textbooks is stressful.</strong> We all know that textbooks are overpriced, and savvy consumers know that the secret to saving money is to shop around. However, the time spent comparing prices for a dozen books each semester really adds up. Strapped for time, many students buy all of their textbooks from their school bookstore, overspending by hundreds of dollars. We were tired of watching our friends get ripped off and knew there had to be a better way.</p>

<p><strong>GetchaBooks is the best of both worlds.</strong> By combining school textbooks listings with an easy-to-use price comparison system, GetchaBooks gives you the convenience of your school bookstore with the power of robust comparison shopping. You tell us what courses you're taking and we'll tell you the best way to get all of your assigned books from well-known and trusted sellers like Amazon, Half, and Chegg.</p>
