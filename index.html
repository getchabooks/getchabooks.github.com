<h1>Goodbye.</h1>

<p>We're sad to announce that we have shut down GetchaBooks.</p>

<p>This was a difficult decision for us. Over the last few years, we've loved building GetchaBooks. We were able to solve challenging technical problems and start a business, all while doing something we believe in: helping students save money.</p>

<p>We were lucky to be able to build a business around work we found rewarding, and were more successful than we ever dreamed was possible for a few college students working on a side project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that level of success wasn't enough to justify working on GetchaBooks full-time. We would have liked to continue working on the site after graduating, but running a business like GetchaBooks while working elsewhere isn't sustainable for us. Rather than let the site languish, we've decided to shut it down.</p>

<p>GetchaBooks wouldn't have been possible without your support. Thanks for being amazing customers and friends.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Ricky Mondello, Mike Walker, and Mike White

Otherwise, check out <a href="http://slugbooks.com">SlugBooks</a>, <a href="http://coursebooks.com">CourseBooks</a>, or <a href="http://textyard.com">TextYard</a>, which are all similar to GetchaBooks.</p>

<p class='ps'>P.P.S. If you're technically-minded and want to pick up where we've left off, we've released all of the code that makes up GetchaBooks. More information is available on our <a href="open-source.html">open source page</a>.</p>
